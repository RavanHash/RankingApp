# RankingApp

I have developed a basic React application that utilizes a .NET Web API component for integration. To achieve this, I utilized the 'ASP.NET Core with React.js' project template. The application I built allows users to rank items by dragging and dropping them from a list onto a cell position on a ranking grid. The ranking grid is positioned above the list of items. Each cell on the grid represents a ranking value, such that the top left cell is position number 1, indicating the top-ranked item. The cell immediately to the right represents the 2nd ranked item, and so on. The bottom right cell represents the lowest ranking position. This was an enjoyable project that provided me with insights into building a simple app using React on the front-end, while leveraging a .NET Web API component on the backend.
